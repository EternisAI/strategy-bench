"""Game-specific prompts and instructions for Among Us with spatial mechanics.

This module contains all the instructions that agents see for different actions.
The generic LLM agent reads these instructions and responds with JSON.

SPATIAL MECHANICS:
- The spaceship has 14 rooms (Skeld map)
- Players move via corridors (1 room per action)
- Impostors can use vents for fast travel
- Only players in the same room can see each other
- Tasks must be completed in specific rooms
- Kills only work if impostor and target are in the same room
